            I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Stanford
            University. My coursework includes web development, algorithms, and
            data structures. I am actively involved in various coding clubs and
            hackathons, where I collaborate with fellow students to build
            innovative projects.

            I completed a diploma in Software Engineering at Zindua School of
            Software Engineering. During my time there, I gained hands-on
            experience in web development, including front-end and back-end
            technologies. I worked on several projects that allowed me to apply
            my skills in real-world scenarios.

             I completed my high school education at Lenana School, where I
             developed a strong foundation in mathematics and science. My time at
             Lenana School instilled in me a passion for problem-solving and
             critical thinking, which I apply to my work as a web developer.
